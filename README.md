# CNN-project
[![Python Lint](https://github.com/nickhib/CNN-project/actions/workflows/py_lint_check.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/nickhib/CNN-project/actions/workflows/py_lint_check.yml) <br>

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network to correctly classify handwritten digits.

## Data:
The dataset used for this project will come from MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which provides a dataset with training images and their labels, as well as a dataset with test images and their correct labels.

## Algorithm:
We intend to use a convolutional neural network to solve this problem. 

## Tools:
We will implement this project in Python using the TensorFlow libraryâ€™s implementation of a CNN. 

## Run the Docker Environment:
```
docker build -t cnn-project .
docker run -it cnn-project
```

Now you're in the Docker container!<br>
Run "python test.py" to verify everything is working.<br>
Type "exit" to leave container.
